Thank you for visiting the (very) early stages of my GitHub Repo!

This will contain my project portfolio with everything from Hardware Hacking Embedded Linux Devices... to Bash Scripts... to building a unique, open-source SIEM-like tool for small/medium businesses.

For work opportunities, or to discuss future projects, please feel free to contact me directly at
